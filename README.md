# Docker Learning Journey

A comprehensive guide documenting my journey learning Docker, with a focus on both functionality and security best practices.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal notes, cheat sheets, and examples as I learn Docker from the ground up. As an intermediate Python programmer learning Docker and agent programming, I'm creating documentation that will help me and other beginners understand not just how Docker works, but how to use it securely.

## Course Progress

- [x] Basic container lifecycle commands
- [ ] Dockerfile basics
- [ ] Docker Compose
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Volumes and data persistence
- [ ] Security deep dive
- [ ] Production best practices

## Learning Resources

- **Primary Course:** [Your Udemy Course Name]
- **Additional Resources:**
  - [Docker Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
  - [Docker Security Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/)
  - [OWASP Docker Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)

## Goals

1. Master Docker fundamentals
2. Understand security implications of container deployment
3. Build secure, production-ready containerized applications
4. Create comprehensive documentation for future reference
5. Eventually contribute to teaching materials for AI agent programming

## Security Focus

Unlike many tutorials that treat security as an afterthought, this documentation emphasizes secure practices from day one:
- Running containers as non-root users
- Image vulnerability scanning
- Secrets management
- Network isolation
- Resource limits and constraints
- Regular security audits

## Contributing to My Own Learning

As I progress, I'll:
- Add practical examples from projects
- Document common pitfalls and solutions
- Create comparison charts for different approaches
- Build a quick reference guide
- Note questions and discoveries

## Future Plans

This documentation will eventually serve as reference material for:
- Personal projects requiring containerization
- AI agent development and deployment
- A beginner's guide to agent programming
